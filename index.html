    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals (Alabaster, Beaver, Pale Taupe) with a soft teal accent (Cadet Blue) for a calm, professional, and academic feel. -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page application with a fixed sidebar for module navigation and a dynamic main content area. This structure provides a clear, consistent user experience, allowing students to easily navigate between modules without page reloads, promoting non-linear exploration. Each module combines concise theory with interactive elements (case studies, dilemmas, quizzes) to promote active learning over passive reading, directly addressing the request for less lecture and more participation. This design supports both self-study and a flipped-classroom model. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Prevalence of ethical issues faced by PhDs -> Goal: Inform/Engage -> Viz: Bar Chart -> Interaction: Hover for data points -> Justification: Provides an immediate, data-driven hook showing the course's relevance. Library: Chart.js (Canvas). Report Info: Decision process for authorship -> Goal: Organize/Guide -> Presentation: Interactive HTML/CSS Diagram -> Interaction: Click on steps to reveal details -> Justification: Visually simplifies a complex decision-making process into actionable steps. Method: HTML/CSS with JS. Report Info: Ethical dilemmas -> Goal: Engage/Assess -> Presentation: Interactive Quiz/Scenario Cards -> Interaction: User selects an option and receives immediate feedback -> Justification: Fosters active critical thinking and application of principles. Method: Vanilla JS. -->
